## **Project Description**
### _~reflections~_

Create an app with very clean visuals, varying photos, and links to manage stress, as well as 60 second instant mindful breathing exercise. While simple, these breathing exercises and taking a moment with oneself can have a drastic outcome on your day. 2-4 screens with reusable modules (buttons etc), a clean user interface and possibly customization. (See stretch goals). Focus remains on a calm vibe and design, and simplistic interface lending credence to the feeling that finding calm and peace was within yourself all along, not your phone.

## **Wireframes**

_coming **very** soon or by EOD 10/3, they've been living in my head quite distinctly_


### **MVP User Stories**

_AAU,_
- I want an app that is easy to access on any device, and fast
- I want an app with a great design so I can focus on focusing on nothing
- I want an app with no ads or paywalls, as that is the opposite of de-stressing
- I want to be able to remember the times that I was able to grow on my own
- I want an app that will remind me to remind myself that I'm awesome without being intrusive

### **MVP Stretch Goals** (silver)

This list was hard to make due to what I realized I couldn't yet make. The MVP is about as bare-bones as it gets
- [Material UI](https://mui.com/)-- This was almost included in MVP, but I just wasn't sure of where I'd be with time complexity.
- More customisable interface
- Choose quotes by category/author/subject. The api is flexible as such.
- More panels and overall interactivity, mostly surrounding wellness and mental health (use React Router)
- Ability to save, tag and share quotes _and_ art.
- Interactive journal to share your thoughts to your own self

### **Gold-Tier Stretch Goals**

- Track personal goals (weight loss, drink less, quit habits etc.)
- Access other API's or even link to other resources
- Integrate sound of some kind, whether pulled or open source ambiance in the app
- Binaural Beats (simple in concept, not necessarily in code)
- AI art (haven't had time to research)

## **API**

[Luke Peavey's Quotable API](https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable/blob/master/README.md) Verified to support CORS and not have oauth. Is HTTPS and even includes [several examples](https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable/blob/master/README.md#examples-) of code pens that can successfully fetch which is itself an example of CORS

_I may include another API here for stretch goals if time allows, most likely art, then audio, if any_

## **Component Hierarchy**

Provide a link to a diagram of showing the React component hierarchy of your app.
- _Still figuring this out as I haven't fully figured out how menus integrate into [this concept](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html#step-1-break-the-ui-into-a-component-hierarchy) across several menus. I've never even seen an example._

#### **OPTIONAL:**

**Check back soon for update**
You can optionally can describe the components further and indicate which will have state or props.
